# Quick Cash (Android App)

Quick Cash is a location based mobile application that connects people who need small paid jobs completed with nearby users willing to do them. The app supports role based user interactions, job discovery, payments, notifications, and reputation tracking.

## Project Overview
The goal of Quick Cash is to prototype a micro job marketplace that enables short term, local work such as lawn mowing, tutoring, repairs, or grocery pickup. Users can act as either employers or employees, with clearly separated responsibilities and app experiences.
